# AutoNosNode
Automatically start Nosana Node on tty1 for Ubuntu Server

The objective of this script is to automatically launch Nosana Node on Ubuntu Server 22.04.  
It will resmble operation of the node as if the user manually logged-in and ran the Nosana node start script.  
This will be 100% familiar to a novice owner/operator who may already be doing the manual tasks.

Before using this script, users will need to type the command: chmod +x autonosnode.sh
