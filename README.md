# autonosnode1.sh
Automatically start Nosana Node on tty1 for Ubuntu Server
For Ubuntu Desktop (GUI is already on tty1) review this repository's branch autonosnode2.sh to start Nosana node on tty2.

The objective of this script is to automatically launch Nosana Node on Ubuntu Server 22.04.  
It will resmble operation of the node as if the user manually logged-in and ran the Nosana node start script in the cli.  
This will be 100% familiar to a novice owner/operator who may already be doing the manual tasks.

Before running this script, the user will need to type the command: chmod +x autonosnode1.sh

To take full advantage of this script, users will need to edit the BIOS of their PC to automatically restart the PC after power is reapplied.

e.g. after an outage with their mains utility/power company.
